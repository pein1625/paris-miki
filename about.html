                            <p><strong>HANDLING COMPLAINTS</strong><br><strong>RESOLVE THINGS ON THE SPOT IF POSSIBLE:</strong></p>
                            <p>Often a customer's dissatisfaction first becomes evident at the point of sale.</p>
                            <p>Ideally, we should resolve customer's complaints immediately if we can. If this cannot be achieved, we should refer customers to Paris Miki's complaints resolution process (outlined below).</p>
                            <p><strong>PARIS MIKI VALUES ENABLE ISSUES TO BE RAISED:</strong><br>The Paris Miki Complaints Handling Policy and Procedures also covers internal complaints. This allows employees to contribute to the improvement of Paris Miki's performance.</p>
                            <p><strong>COMPLAINTS RESOLUTION PROCESS:</strong><br>The Complaints Register records the details of each complaint along with how and when it was resolved.</p>
                            <p>It is the responsibility of the Paris Miki employee directly handling a complaint to advise one of the Complaints Handling Representatives of the progress and outcome of the complaint they are handling.</p>
                            <p>As you will see from the stages outlined below, if a complaint is not resolved within a particular timeframe, the complaint must be escalated to one of the Complaints Handling Representatives. The Complaints Handling Representative is not required to follow-up with those directly handling a complaint before escalation takes place.</p>
                            <p><strong>STAGE 1</strong></p>
                            <p>Customers may make complaints:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>in-person at the store;</li>
                                <li>by phone to Yoshiki Mukai on (02) 8425 6000</li>
                                <li>by email , the address being: Customers@paris-miki.com.au; or</li>
                                <li>through the Paris Miki website, the address being: www.paris-miki.com.au, then going to "Contact us'..</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>For all complaints received, immediately acknowledge receipt of a complaint (if the complaint is not received in person, this can be done by a phone call or email).</p>
                            <p>Our aim is to resolve complaints immediately, wherever possible. Although more complex issues may not be resolved on-the-spot, the customer is to be made aware that their matter is under investigation.</p>
                            <p>If the complaint cannot be resolved on-the-spot, the team member handling the complaint should:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>gather sufficient detail about the complaint in order to properly investigate and respond, eg complaints logs or product information</li>
                                <li>consult with others where appropriate, eg suppliers or staff</li>
                                <li>communicate clearly and professionally with the complainant, verbally and/or in writing</li>
                                <li>retain a file on the complaint including dates, actions taken and outcomes and advise one of the Complaints Handling Representative of this</li>
                                <li>keep the Complaints Handling Representative informed (including dates and outcomes) so the Complaints Register can be updated.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>STAGE 2</strong><br>If the team member cannot resolve a complaint within 3 working days, the matter will be passed on to the relevant Area Manager.</p>
                            <p><strong>STAGE 3</strong><br>If the Area Manager cannot resolve a complaint within 3 working days, the matter will be escalated to one of the Complaints Handling Representatives.</p>
                            <p><strong>REMEDIES AND SOLUTIONS</strong></p>
                            <p>There are a number of remedies available to address customer complaints. These reflect good industry practice, what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances and ensuring our legal obligations are met. The remedy selected for a particular complaint depends on the nature and details of issue.</p>
                            <p>Some options might include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Refund or replacement</li>
                                <li>Information/explanation > Provide customer with details or advice technical assistance where such support can be obtained.</li>
                                <li>An apology > You should discuss these options with Paris Miki's Compliance Officer</li>
                                <li>A goodwill gift or token</li>
                                <li>Compensation</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>WHAT IF WE ARE NOT AT FAULT OR LIABLE?</strong><br>If, after a thorough investigation, it is determined that Paris Miki is not at fault or liable a carefully worded letter should be sent to the customer to explain our findings. This must be approved by one of Paris Miki's Complaints Handling Representatives before being sent to the customer.</p>
                            <p><strong>WHAT IF THE COMPLAINT IS NOT RESOLVED TO THE CUSTOMER'S SATISFACTION?</strong><br>If the complainant rejects Paris Miki's proposed decision or action, the complaint should remain open on the Complaints Register. This should be recorded and the complainant should be informed of alternative forms of external recourse available.</p>
                            <p><strong>COMMUNICATING AND RECORDING</strong><br>If you are responsible for handling a complaint the following steps will help.</p>
                            <p><strong>ALLOCATING COMPLAINTS</strong><br>Our Store Managers are the main contact point for dissatisfied customers.</p>
                            <p>Complaints may also be received directly by one of Paris Miki's Complaints Handling Representatives (by phone or mail). Any and all complaints to do with product safety, promotions or other marketing representations must be referred to one of the Complaints Handling Representatives.</p>
                            <p>All complaints received will be recorded in the Complaints Register. A separate record will be kept of any complaints that are product safety or otherwise relevant to consumer protection.</p>
                            <p><strong>LISTEN FIRST</strong><br>When handling a complaint the first step is always to speak with the complainant and listen to their problem.</p>
                            <p><strong>THE DISCUSSION</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Politely identify yourself and listen to the customer without interrupting</li>
                                <li>Acknowledge there is a problem and that it may be annoying, inconvenient or unfortunate</li>
                                <li>Ask the customer what outcome they would like – don’t assume</li>
                                <li>Confirm all details and ask questions to clarify, if necessary</li>
                                <li>Resolve the complaint if possible</li>
                                <li>Explain the possible courses of action available but do not commit to anything unless certain</li>
                                <li>If a resolution is not possible immediately, then confirm you will pass the matter on for further attention</li>
                                <li>Ensure that the customer is informed that the complaint is receiving attention, without creating any false expectations</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>YOUR ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOUR</strong></p>

                                <li>You may not believe the customer’s complaint is justified but remember that, although they may not be “right” in your opinion, they are telling you because they are unhappy. Their complaint is an opportunity to retain their business.</li>
                                <li>Stay calm. This may be difficult if the customer is irritating or if their complaint seems trivial, but getting angry won’t help.</li>
                                <li>Never raise your voice</li>
                                <li>Do not lay blame on the company or individuals</li>
